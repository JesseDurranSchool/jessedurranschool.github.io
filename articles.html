					The Magic of Transistors 
				</h1>
				<h3 class="right-text">

				<p>
					&emsp;
					Transistors are a very special component that are used in many, many ways. They are used in
					logic circuits in nearly all parts of a computer, and are very reliable. There are several types of
					transistor, which all have different purposes.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					At its heart, a transistor is a tool for controlling current with signals. It has three pins, a collector, a base, and
					an emitter. The collector takes in the main current, which is then sent on to the next part of the
					circuit by the emitter, but only if the base pin is recieving the correct current.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					There are a few very important things to consider when using a transistor. For one, it has
					polarity. The current must always go into the collector pin, and leave the emitter pin.
					These are sometimes called the cathode and the anode respectively. Another important thing to remember
					is that a transistor is not a resistor. While all connections technically do have a measure of
					resistance, in the case of most transistors, this is negligible. Be careful to always
					make sure you have enough resistance to protect your components.

					How to use an SCR Chip 
				</h1>
				<h3 class="right-text">
					By: Jesse Durran
				</h3>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					An SCR, or silicon controlled rectifier, chip works like a diode, in the way that it only allows current through in one direction, but
					with the addition of a third control pin, known as the gate. Once a current is supplied to the gate pin,
					current will be allowed to flow through until the circuit is reset, even if the current is subsequently removed from
					the gate pin.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					This chip is especially useful in logic where something needs to be locked on as it recieves a signal, 
					such as a burglar alarm, or some kind of emergency light that runs on battery power.

					Make Your Own Graphics Card 
				</h1>
				<h3 class="right-text">
					By: Jesse Durran
				</h3>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					Graphics cards are important. Every modern computer comes with a graphics card, and for good reason.
					They are used to calculate what is supposed to be shown on screen, as well as doing other simple
					calculations at a speed which a CPU is uncapable of.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					The graphics card we make in this article will not be able to calculate complicated 3D graphics, or anything,
					but it will be able to send an image to a monitor, which is a excellent proof of concept. The components
					you will need are different depending on what kind of connector you use. The first part of this article
					will be discussing VGA connections, while the second will discuss HDMI. VGA is an older connector,
					but it is still reliable, and new computers and monitors are sometimes still manufactured with it.
					HDMI is a newer type of connection that can transfer full HD video, and it can also send sound with the
					same connector.
