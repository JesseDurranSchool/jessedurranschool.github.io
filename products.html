					Circuitboard Kit #I
				</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					This kit has everything you'll need to learn the basics of how basic circuit boards work.
					It has a breadboard, several types of resistor, several capacitors, several transistors, several 
					integrated circuits, several SCR chips, a few coils of wire, some special components, such as LED's and
					speakers, some tools, and more.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					With this kit, you'll be able to make several interesting projects, such as a transistor oscillator, 
					and a 16-bit counter. You will even be able to learn how to make some basic logic gates. The enclosed
					instructions will tell you everything you need to know, as well as explaining how they work, and
					what they can be used for.

				<h2>
					Circuitboard Kit #II
				</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					This kit is meant to build on the concepts taught in Circuitboard Kit #I. While it isn't required to
					have done the previous kit, because the instructions are exact, it is recommended that you have at
					least a basic knowledge of circuit components before starting. This kit contains a breadboard, several
					types of resistor, several capacitors, several transistors, several integrated circuits,
					several SCR chips, several sensors, a few coils of wire, some special components, such as LED's and speakers,
					some tools, and more.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					With this kit, you will be able to make many interesting projects, such as a burglar alarm, and a
					time-activated light. You will use some logic gates to build these projects, and you'll learn some digital
					logic as well. The instructions will provide all the necessary information, and you can learn all about
					the theory with the in-depth analisis pages in the booklet. In addition, the application of these projects will
					alse be explained.

				<h2>
					Computer Science Kit #I
				</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					This kit has everything you'll need to learn the basics of how computer logic works. It has 2 breadboards,
					assorted integrated circuits, many logic gates, a few coils of wire, some special components, such as
					LED's and 7-segment displays, some tools, and more.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					With this kit, you'll be able to make several interesting projects, such as an 8-bit adder and subtractor,
					and a logic probe. The enclosed instructions will provide information on the internal mechanics of the gates, 
					a value table for each gate, and information on how to build each project, as well as how they work.
					Also included in this kit is a pamphlet with an explanation on how digital logic works, and several more
					explanations on this topic.

				<h2>
					Computer Science Kit #II
				</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					This kit is designed to build off of what you learned in Computer Science Kit #I. It is a standalone kit,
					but it is recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of how it works. This kit contains
					two breadboards, many logic gates, both simple, as well as complicated, a few coils of wire, some special components,
					such as LED's and 7-segment displays, some tools, and more.
					<br>
					<br>
					&emsp;
					With this kit, you'll be able to make a very basic computationam machime, which can connect to the
					provided simple graphics card, and plugged into a monitor with either VGA or HDMI. In addition, you
					can use this kit with Computer Science Kit #I to make some even cooler and more advanced projects.

					Basics of Circuits and Computers Kit
				</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp;
					This kit contains Circuitboard Kits #I and # II, as well as Computer Science Kits #I and II. In addition,
					there is extra information, and several extra components, and a voucher for a full year's subscription to
					Breadboard Magazine.
					<br>
					<br>
					This kit is the all-inclusive set for computer basics. You'll be able to build a basic computer with a
					speaker that can play small MP4 files, or you can build a Bluetooth speaker that you can customize.
